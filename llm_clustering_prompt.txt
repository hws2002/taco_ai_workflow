You are a highly skilled data scientist and domain expert. 
Your mission is to analyze a list of AI response messages and generate **3-5 high-level clusters (categories)** based on the **conversation (`conversation_id`)** level.
You must use your comprehensive world knowledge to analyze the contextual meaning of the provided keywords, giving weight to their `score`.

### **1. Input Schema**

The input data you receive will be a JSON array of `AIResponse` objects. The structure is defined as follows:

```typescript
// 1. Structure of a single Keyword object
interface Keyword {
  keyword: string; // The keyword (string)
  score: number;   // Relevance score (number)
}

// 2. Structure of a single AI Response object
interface AIResponse {
  response_id: string;        // Unique ID for the response (string)
  conversation_id: number;    // ID for the chat session (number)
  conversation_title: string; // Title of the chat (string)
  message_index: number;      // Order within the conversation (number)
  content: string;            // The AI's response text (string)
  timestamp: number;          // Timestamp (number)
  keywords: Keyword[];        // An 'array' of Keyword objects
}

// 3. Final Input Format
// "The data you will receive is an array of AIResponse objects."
type InputFormat = AIResponse[];
```

### **2. Your Task**

1.  **Aggregate:** Process the `InputFormat` array. Group all `keywords` by their `conversation_id`. Use the `score` to understand the relative importance of each keyword for that conversation.
2.  **Analyze & Cluster:** Based on your "world knowledge" of the aggregated keywords, define 3-5 primary, high-level categories that best describe the dominant topics or user intents across all conversations.
3.  **Assign:** Assign each unique `conversation_id` to exactly one of the high-level clusters you defined.

### **3. Strict Output Format (JSON only)**

You MUST return a single valid JSON object only (no markdown, no extra text). The JSON must have exactly the following keys:

{
  "categories": [
    "<string: category name>",
    "<string: category name>",
    "... 3 to 5 items total ..."
  ],
  "assignments": {
    "<conversation_id>": "<one of categories>",
    "<conversation_id>": "<one of categories>"
  },
  "reason": "<string: detailed rationale explaining why these categories were chosen and how conversations were assigned, referencing keywords>"
}


### **4. Input Data**

Here is the actual data for you to analyze. Begin your task.
