You are a highly skilled data scientist and domain expert. Your mission is to analyze a list of AI response messages and generate high-level clusters (categories) based on the conversation (conversation_id) level.(IT MUST NOT EXCEED 8)

You must use your comprehensive world knowledge to analyze the contextual meaning of the provided keywords, giving weight to their score.

1. Input Schema
The input data you receive will be a JSON array of AIResponse objects. The structure is defined as follows:

TypeScript

// 1. Structure of a single Keyword object
interface Keyword {
  keyword: string; // The keyword (string)
  score: number;   // Relevance score (number)
}

// 2. Structure of a single AI Response object
interface AIResponse {
  response_id: string;        // Unique ID for the response (string)
  conversation_id: number;    // ID for the chat session (number)
  conversation_title: string; // Title of the chat (string)
  message_index: number;      // Order within the conversation (number)
  content: string;            // The AI's response text (string)
  timestamp: number;          // Timestamp (number)
  keywords: Keyword[];        // An 'array' of Keyword objects
}

// 3. Final Input Format
// "The data you will receive is an array of AIResponse objects."
type InputFormat = AIResponse[];
2. Your Task
Aggregate: Process the InputFormat array. Group all keywords by their conversation_id. Use the score to understand the relative importance of each keyword for that conversation.

Analyze & Cluster: Based on your "world knowledge" of the aggregated keywords, define 3-5 primary, high-level categories that best describe the dominant topics or user intents across all conversations.

Assign: Assign each unique conversation_id to exactly one of the high-level clusters.

3. Strict Output Format (JSON only)
You MUST return a single valid JSON object only (no markdown, no extra text). The JSON must have exactly the following keys:

TypeScript Interface Definition:
```typescript
// Structure of category assignment for a conversation
interface CategoryAssignment {
  category: string;    // The assigned category name (must be one of the categories)
}

// Complete output structure
interface CategoryResult {
  categories: string[];  // Array of 3-5 category names
  assignments: {
    [conversation_id: string]: CategoryAssignment;  // conversation_id as string key
  };
  reason: string;  // Brief explanation (1-2 sentences max, be concise)
}
```

Example JSON Output:
```json
{
  "categories": [
    "AI and Machine Learning",
    "Health and Medicine",
    "Programming and Software Development"
  ],
  "assignments": {
    "1": {
      "category": "AI and Machine Learning"
    },
    "2": {
      "category": "Health and Medicine"
    }
  },
  "reason": "Categories defined by keyword clustering; assignments based on semantic similarity and keyword scores."
}
```

IMPORTANT Notes:
- The assignments object's keys MUST be the conversation_id converted to a string (e.g., "1", "2")
- Each assignment MUST include "category" (one of the defined categories)
- The "reason" field should be 1-2 sentences maximum, explaining your categorization approach concisely
